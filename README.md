Country Compare
===============

For this project, our team was tasked with finding a dataset, parsing it, and storing it in a [Map](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html "Java Map API"). We were also asked to find a way to visually analyze the data using [Processing](https://www.processing.org "Processing API")

After deciding on [this dataset from](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world "Countries of The World") [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ "Kaggle"), we set out our expectations for the project.

### Goals
* Graph the data consistently across multiple variables (Bar graph)
* Implement a method for selecting variables manually
* Cross compare variables as X and Y (Scatterplot)
* Perform and display calculations for specific values (Mean, Standard Deviation, Correlation, etc.)
* Design a functional and visually pleasing user interface
